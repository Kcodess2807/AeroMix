# AEROMIX

AeroMix is a touchless DJ system that leverages OpenCV and YOLO for real-time hand gesture recognition. It allows users to control music features such as bass, volume, scratching, looping, and effects using intuitive gestures, creating a futuristic and interactive DJ experience. The system also includes a dynamic music visualizer and supports multi-hand detection for more complex controls.

## Features

- **Real-time hand gesture detection:** Uses advanced computer vision (OpenCV and YOLO) to recognize and interpret DJ gestures instantly for seamless control.

- **Intuitive music controls:**
  - **Tempo:** Adjust the speed (BPM) of your tracks in real time, enabling smooth beatmatching and creative transitions.
  - **Pitch:** Change the pitch of audio independently or in sync with tempo, allowing for key changes, harmonic mixing, or vinyl-style effects.
  - **Effects:** Apply DJ effects such as filters, echoes, and reverbs using hand gestures, adding dynamic expression to your mixes.
  - **Playback sequence:** Control track playback, trigger loops, jump to cue points, or rearrange song sections with intuitive gestures for live remixing and creative arrangements.

- **Dynamic visualizer:** Visual feedback responds to both music and user gestures, enhancing the interactive experience.

- **Multi-hand detection:** Recognizes and processes multiple hands for advanced, multi-control interactions, enabling complex DJ techniques and simultaneous feature adjustments.
