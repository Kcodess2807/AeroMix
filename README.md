# Air DJ

Air DJ is a touchless DJ system that leverages OpenCV and YOLO for real-time hand gesture recognition. It allows users to control music features such as bass, volume, scratching, looping, and effects using intuitive gestures, creating a futuristic and interactive DJ experience. The system also includes a dynamic music visualizer and supports multi-hand detection for more complex controls.

## Features

- **Real-time hand gesture detection:** Uses computer vision to recognize and interpret DJ gestures.
- **Intuitive music controls:** Adjust bass, volume, apply effects, and perform scratching or looping-all with your hands in the air.
- **Dynamic visualizer:** Visual feedback responds to music and user gestures.
- **Multi-hand detection:** Recognizes multiple hands for advanced, multi-control interactions.
