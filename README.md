# Real-Time Gesture-Based Audio Control System

This repository documents my implementation of a real-time gesture-based audio control system, inspired by [A Real-Time Gesture-Based Control Framework]. My goal is to build an interactive application that allows users to manipulate sound and music in real time using body movements, leveraging computer vision and machine learning.

## Project Motivation

Traditional audio control interfaces (knobs, sliders, keyboards) can be limiting for performers and interactive installations. Inspired by recent advances in gesture recognition and real-time sound control, I set out to create a system where users can intuitively manipulate music and sound using gestures, making audio interaction more expressive and accessible.

## Reference Paper Summary

The reference paper presents a real-time, human-in-the-loop gesture control framework that adapts audio and music based on human movement via live video input. The system uses computer vision (MediaPipe) for landmark extraction, Max/MSP for multimedia processing, and Python-based machine learning for gesture classification. It enables users to train custom gestures (with as few as 50–80 samples), map them to audio controls, and perform real-time manipulation of sound features such as tempo, pitch, and effects.

## System Overview

**Key Features:**

- Real-time gesture recognition using MediaPipe
- User-friendly gesture training and mapping workflow
- Low-latency audio control via **Pyo** (Python audio synthesis library)
- Modular design: Python for ML and audio, OSC for communication
- Supports both performance scenarios (cue-based and continuous control)

## Architecture

### Main Components

| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| Pyo       | Real-time audio synthesis and manipulation in Python |
| MediaPipe | Real-time body/hand/face landmark detection |
| Python    | Trains and runs gesture classification models (MLP) |
| OSC       | Real-time bridge between gesture recognition and audio |

### Data Flow

1. **Video Capture:** Python/OpenCV captures webcam video.
2. **Landmark Extraction:** MediaPipe extracts body/hand landmarks.
3. **Gesture Classification:** Python classifies gestures (training or inference).
4. **Audio Control:** Recognized gesture directly manipulates Pyo audio parameters in real time.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Hardware:** Computer with webcam and speakers/headphones
- **Software:**
    - Python 3.x
    - Python packages: `mediapipe`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `python-osc`, `pyo`, `opencv-python`
    - (Optional) Jupyter Notebook for experiments

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone this repository.**
2. **Install Python dependencies:**
    ```
    pip install mediapipe numpy scikit-learn python-osc pyo opencv-python
    ```
3. **Configure OSC communication if needed.**

## Usage Guide

### Training Phase

1. **Start the Python gesture training script** to capture video and extract landmarks.
2. **Collect gesture samples:**
    - Select a gesture to train (e.g., "raise right hand").
    - System guides you through sample collection with metronome/visual cues.
    - Perform the gesture at each cue; neutral movements fill "other" class.
3. **Model Training:**
    - Python script trains an MLP classifier on your samples.
    - Review metrics; if accuracy is low, add more samples or corner cases.
    - Save the trained model and scaler for reuse.

### Mapping Phase

- In Python, assign each trained gesture to an audio control (e.g., volume up, trigger sound, change effect).
- Choose scenario:
    - **Performance cue** (e.g., trigger song section)
    - **Continuous control** (e.g., adjust gain in real time)

### Performance Phase

- **Start the Python application.**
- **Perform gestures in front of the webcam.**
- **System recognizes gestures and triggers mapped audio actions in real time (latency < 200 ms) using Pyo.**

## Experiments & Evaluation

- **Tested with multiple users and gestures (hand/leg raises, etc.).**
- **Sample counts:** 50–80 per gesture for stable accuracy.
- **Model:** MLP classifier; achieved 90–95% accuracy for basic gestures.
- **Latency:** End-to-end system response under 0.2 seconds.
- **Scenarios tested:**
    - Dance performance cueing (timed gesture triggers)
    - Real-time sound control (volume/pitch/effect adjustment)
- **Comparative evaluation:** Similar accuracy to MediaPipe’s built-in hand gesture recognition.

## Key Learnings & Future Work

**Learnings:**
- Modular architecture (Pyo + Python + OSC) enables flexible experimentation.
- User-specific training is crucial for high accuracy; generalized models need diverse data.
- Real-time feedback and low latency are achievable with careful engineering.

**Future Work:**
- Enhance robustness to lighting/background changes.
- Expand gesture vocabulary and support for more complex gestures.
- Explore integration with other creative coding environments (e.g., Unity, TouchDesigner).
- Investigate adaptive learning and user-independent models.
